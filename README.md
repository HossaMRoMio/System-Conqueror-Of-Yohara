# System-Conqueror-Of-Yohara
 Conqueror-of-Yohara


# NOTE

1. The maps are empty, in essence it's the system.

2. If you want to add the monsters on the maps you can contact me and, I add the monsters and put your credits, the truth was I was lazy :'(.

3. I can upload updates if you need it.

4. In essence if you are level 1 or higher, you become "Conqueror", otherwise you are a normal player, your job is simply to add that after Hydra, though, I'll add it later.
